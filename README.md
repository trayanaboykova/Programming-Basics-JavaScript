<b>Course Curriculum: Programming Basics with JavaScript</b>

First Steps In Coding: In this introductory module, I covered the basics of programming using JavaScript. I learned about fundamental concepts, syntax, and the structure of JavaScript programs.

Conditional Statements: During this module, I delved into conditional statements in JavaScript. I learned how to use if-else statements to make decisions in my code. I also gained knowledge on handling multiple conditions using logical operators and writing code that dynamically responds to user input or specific criteria.

Conditional Statements Advanced: Building upon the basics, I explored advanced conditional statements in JavaScript. I mastered concepts such as nested if-else statements, switch statements, and the ternary operator. These advanced techniques equipped me to handle complex decision-making scenarios in my JavaScript programs effectively.

For-Loop: In this module, I focused on the usage of loops in JavaScript. I gained proficiency in utilizing for-loops to repeat code a specific number of times, and solve problems that require repetitive actions.

While-Loop: During the while-loop module, I learned about creating loops that execute as long as a specific condition remains true. I learned how to use while-loops effectively in JavaScript programs, especially for scenarios that involve continuous repetition until a certain condition is met.

Nested Loops: The nested loops module introduced the concept of having one loop inside another in JavaScript. During the course, I learned how to work with nested loops to perform operations on each element of basic data structures. I gained proficiency in utilizing nested loops to solve various coding problems that involve repetitive actions and iteration.

By completing the "Programming Basics with JavaScript" course, I have acquired the basics in JavaScript programming. I am now equipped with knowledge of JavaScript syntax, conditional statements, loop constructs, and problem-solving techniques using JavaScript.
