<b>Course Curriculum: Programming Basics with JavaScript</b>

**[First Steps In Coding](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Basics-JavaScript/tree/main/01-first-steps-in-coding)**: <br> 
In this introductory module, I covered the basics of programming using JavaScript. I learned about fundamental concepts, syntax, and the structure of JavaScript programs.

**[Conditional Statements](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Basics-JavaScript/tree/main/02-conditional-statements)**: <br>
During this module, I delved into conditional statements in JavaScript. I learned how to use if-else statements to make decisions in my code. I also gained knowledge on handling multiple conditions using logical operators and writing code that dynamically responds to user input or specific criteria.

**[Conditional Statements Advanced](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Basics-JavaScript/tree/main/03-conditional-statements-advanced)**: <br>
Building upon the basics, I explored advanced conditional statements in JavaScript. I mastered concepts such as nested if-else statements, switch statements, and the ternary operator. These advanced techniques equipped me to handle complex decision-making scenarios in my JavaScript programs effectively.

**[For-Loop](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Basics-JavaScript/tree/main/04-for-loop)**: <br>
In this module, I focused on the usage of loops in JavaScript. I gained proficiency in utilizing for-loops to repeat code a specific number of times, and solve problems that require repetitive actions.

**[While-Loop](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Basics-JavaScript/tree/main/05-while-loop)**: <br> 
During the while-loop module, I learned about creating loops that execute as long as a specific condition remains true. I learned how to use while-loops effectively in JavaScript programs, especially for scenarios that involve continuous repetition until a certain condition is met.

**[Nested Loops](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Programming-Basics-JavaScript/tree/main/06-nested-loops)**: <br> 
The nested loops module introduced the concept of having one loop inside another in JavaScript. During the course, I learned how to work with nested loops to perform operations on each element of basic data structures. I gained proficiency in utilizing nested loops to solve various coding problems that involve repetitive actions and iteration.

*By completing the [Programming Basics with JavaScript Course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4001/programming-basics-with-javascript-march-2023), I have acquired the basics in JavaScript programming. I am now equipped with knowledge of JavaScript syntax, conditional statements, loop constructs, and problem-solving techniques using JavaScript.*
